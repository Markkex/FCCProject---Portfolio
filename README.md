 Actually this started as a final project for a certification on Free Code Camp. Which i finaly got it the 1st one! :D
 But decided to take it to the next level and start taking as a personal advertisement. 
 
Its not nearly finished from the final vision that i have but its just a start. I will add more to it with time, along with learning more in Free Code Camp! 

Resources and Planning: 
 
 I wanted to make it fully responsive so i looked alot for the possibility of Flexbox. 
The following article helped me alot through this website, from CSS-Tricks.com:
https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/

After that i also found Kevin Powell on Youtube and i got interested on one of his free courses that i took about Responsiveness.
The course name is Conquering Responsive Layouts on https://courses.kevinpowell.co/

As for resources: 
-- Logo is my creation with a help of a friend. We created it on Photoshop Illustrator and i was influenced by Aveden Font. We also use that font on the menu section. 
-- Icons were used from Flaticon.com and all the rights are reserved to the creators.
-- Images are from a few personal jobs. 
-- Background is called Static Noise Background and you can find it here: https://codepen.io/iceable/pen/yLBrZOd

/* What's NEXT? */ 
- Create sitemap and add CEO to the website. 
- Fix the title image on top of the website. 
- Along the way create more and more and add more content to the website (animations, SVG).
