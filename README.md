 Actually this started as a final project for a certification on Free Code Camp. Which i finaly got it the 1st one! :D </br>
 But decided to take it to the next level and start taking as a personal advertisement. </br>
 
Its not nearly finished from the final vision that i have but its just a start. I will add more to it with time, along with learning more in Free Code Camp! </br>

Resources and Planning: </br>
 
 I wanted to make it fully responsive so i looked alot for the possibility of Flexbox. </br>
The following article helped me alot through this website, from CSS-Tricks.com: </br>
https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/ </br>

After that i also found Kevin Powell on Youtube and i got interested on one of his free courses that i took about Responsiveness.
The course name is Conquering Responsive Layouts on https://courses.kevinpowell.co/ </br>

As for resources: </br>
-- Logo is my creation with a help of a friend. We created it on Photoshop Illustrator and i was influenced by Aveden Font. We also use that font on the menu section. </br>
-- Icons were used from Flaticon.com and all the rights are reserved to the creators.</br>
-- Images are from a few personal jobs. </br>
-- Background is called Static Noise Background and you can find it here: https://codepen.io/iceable/pen/yLBrZOd </br>

/* What's NEXT? */ </br>
- Create sitemap and add CEO to the website. </br>
- Fix the title image on top of the website. </br>
- Along the way create more and more and add more content to the website (animations, SVG). </br>
