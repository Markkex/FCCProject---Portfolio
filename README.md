# PortfolioFCC
Portfolio project from FreeCodeCamp.org


I used and learned alot actually! So yeah 1st part of FCC is done! 
I think i made it almost 100% responsive. 

I will link all the resources and animations if you would like to check it more: 

--Kevin Powell
Course: Conquering Responsive Layouts

Actually was one of the best courses i ever done on responsive websites creation and html/css in general! 
I learned to use em and rem and actually i saw alot of changes without changing much on the website with media queries. 

--CSS Tricks 
Title: A Complete Guide to Flexbox (url: https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)

I tried improve the responsiveness with flex box.  Actually almost 100% of the website is done with display: flex. ahah
It is a nice cheatsheet to Flex Box on point of view of the parent and on the point of view of the child div's. 

------ Background ----- 
I used this 'noise' background from Mathieu S. where it creates an old TV screen like. I actually loved it and decided to implement it for myself. 
I also tried to play with it a bit, but decided to keep the same animation at the end. 
I learned alot from  animations with it!
